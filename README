Eden2D (Python 2D Game Script)

Requires Pyglet, Cocos2D, PyCharm and NumPy libraries.

Run main.py to launch game.

Controls:
A,D : Move player left or right.
SPACE: Player jump.
W: Reverse gravity
V: Show/Hide pymunk shapes using GL calls. (currently only the ground segment).
M: Show/Hide menu.
Left Mouse Click: Attack.
Right mouse click: Spawn item. (Select item from menu)

Recent changes:
-Added very basic enemy pathfinding.
-Added colliding map boundaries on left and right edges.
-The menu does not register events when it is not visible.
-Fixed player jumping multiple times in the air. Only jumps once now.
-Added player jumping on walls.
-Press "M" to bring up menu and select items to spawn with right click. If
you select segment, the first two right clicks register the point locations,
and the third click spawns the segment. I will fix this later.


To Do List:
-Implement a pause handler.
-Add mouse event to create pymunk segments in-game.
-Remove blocks that collide with the boundaries and prevent blocks from falling through the ground.
-Add basic enemy AI.
-Procedural world gen? Tile destruction?
...in progress.
