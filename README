Python 2D game development.

Requires Pyglet, Cocos2D, PyCharm and NumPy libraries.

Run main.py to launch game.

Controls:
A,D : Move player left or right.
SPACE: Player jump.
W: Reverse gravity
V: Show/Hide pymunk shapes using GL calls. (currently only the ground segment).

To Do List:
-Add boundaries or sensors to world edges to trigger events if objects collide with them.
-Remove blocks that collide with the boundaries and prevent blocks from falling through the ground.
-Prevent player from jumping if he is already in the air.
-Add basic enemy AI.
-Procedural world gen? Tile destruction?
...in progress.
